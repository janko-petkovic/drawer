# Feedback to karthik

Slide numbers start with title slide 

## 1. Title
Nice slide.

## 2
- Say hi to who's listening to you
- Maybe highlight that the talk has two main sections (comes down to taste)

## 3
## 4
- Is A single neuron (I think)
- What is the "system boundary" that you are talking about? I didn't get it (but
  I didn't sleep a lot today)

## 5

## 6 "Is single neuron robust to perturbations"

## 7 "Motivation"
- We know that biophysical models can be fit to these datasets, I would maybe
  frame a more precise question.
- It is not super clear what the motivation is (are we using Jaxley only because
  its cool?)

## 8
- Could be a good idea to include the two motivations in the title.
- Love the source "pytorch tutorial".

## 9 "can a single neuron recognise digits"
- Cool concept.
- I would put the acc/rob graph bigger, as that's the main focus of the slide?

## 10 "can a single neuron recognise digits"
- You are explaining how your problem is framed, therefore a methodological
  section. Maybe the title should reflect that, as you are focusing on the
  method, not on the question

## 11 Results
- Very nice graphic display, its very clear what we should be looking at. Nice
  colors.
- Clearly state that you are shown TEST performances, not just
  optimizing and seeing how well classifies in the end.
- What I find useful in papers and presentations is to put one figure/slide
  showing clearly the pipeline: dataset + model > training (how) > testing (how)

## 12 Results
- Can you speculate on the performance differences?
- Also, it is good to display the baseline score to have a reference for what is
  a good /bad accuracy (in this case, 50%)

## 13 Results

## 14 Results
- The performance evaluations are point estimates, it would be good to have some
  errorbars

## 15 Results

## 17 Results
- At some point I think it would be interesting to speculate (very loosely, it's
  still an open question) on how and why this robustness is achieved by a
  spiking system (which is the only difference from the other models you used,
  if I understood correctly).

## 17 Limitations, extensions
- A bit rough on the layout, but I like it. Personally, I use light font for
  text and then put in bold the words I want people to focus on.

## 18 Motivation
- What are the things I should be paying attention in this slide?

## 19 Motivation
- Sloppy and stiff directions is a cool concept, never heard of it.
- The picture here really helps understand what you are focusing on, nice choice.

## 20 Motivation
- When you refer to studies, its good to cite the names of one or some of the
  author, not just call them "people" lol

## 21 Proposal

## 22 Methodology
- Slide's a bit cramped, not clear hierarchy.
- An image sketching out your aims could help folliwing (these questions are not
  trivial!)

## 23 Questions to ponder
- Great title

# General
- Repeating Pedro: what are the goals? Few, clear ones.
- Don't look at the slides while talking.
- Good balance between images and text, good slides.
- I'd put more references to give structure, context, and show people that you
  have studied. Also, usually they are reported with "FirstAuthor et al., YYYY",
  which is more readable than the title screenshot. 
- In general, one thing that can be improved is the layering of the presentation
  (what is the overarching story, what are the subordinate research topics, what
  are the specific methods, results, and takeaways of each). But this is
  something that can be suggested to anyone and takes time to master. 

All in all super cool results, gg.

QUESTION:
1. relationship of your work to BCM models
2. what about orthogonal/adversarial attacks?
