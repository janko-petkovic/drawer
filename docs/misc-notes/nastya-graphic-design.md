# Unity

## Proportionality

### Movement

#### Something else

But also
- optimize your space
- don't put things that do not belong to each other in the same color
- don't waste space if it is not needed
- don't choose a style from the 70s if you are in 2025
- hierarchy -> black vs gray
- **ALWAYS ALIGN TO LEFT**
- Always make sure that the **line height is tall enough**
- SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT

```python {1|4|5} +exec +line_numbers
def f():
    print('hi')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    f()
```

its changing

Colors
---
You wanna have a dominating colors
- data: you wanna have the same color
- parameters: you wanna have a different color

Choosing what color schemes to use strongly depends on the context! (example
with products and travels)

- you shouldnt use more than 7 colors in your plot

Composition
---
- It's good to use some additional lines to compose properly
- Always use the same distancings, is disgusting otherwise


Scientific figures

Fonts
---
When you want to convey a message clearly, don't use artsy fonts - better use
sans serif. 


Sayings, graphs, representations
